# KNN_and_SVC
Applying K Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Classifier to Mall Customers Dataset
In this notebook I have applied KNN and SVM techniques to classify 'Age and salary' based data to wheather customer is going to purchase perticular item or not. 
About Dataset: Dataset is having five columns['User ID', 'Gender', 'Age', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Purchased']. From which two are used as an independent variables ie 'Age' and 'EstimatedSalary'. Here "Purchased" is dependent variable, need to classify based on independent variables. 
In case of KNN, I got an accuracy around 88% and for SVC it is around 84%. 
Just by looking at the data-points distribution(Refer notebook), we can easily analyze that why KNN works better than SVC.
